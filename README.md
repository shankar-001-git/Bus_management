Bus Management System
The Bus Management System is a full-stack web application built using Django, designed to manage bus details, travel schedules, routes, and passenger information. The system seamlessly integrates with a PostgreSQL database, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of bus-related data. It also provides a RESTful API accessible via Postman for testing and interacting with the backend, while the UI offers a user-friendly interface for visualizing and managing the data.

Key Features:

Bus Scheduling: Manage and update travel schedules efficiently.
Route Management: Store and display bus routes dynamically.
Passenger Information: Keep track of passenger details in real-time.
PostgreSQL Integration: Robust data storage and handling.
REST API: Accessible via Postman for testing and automation.
User Interface: A clean and intuitive frontend for managing data.
This project demonstrates skills in Django, PostgreSQL, RESTful API development, and full-stack web application design.
